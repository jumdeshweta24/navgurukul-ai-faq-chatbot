---

### **Part 1: Introduction (The "Why")**

**(Presenter):** "Hello everyone, and thank you for joining. Today, we're excited to introduce the **NavGurukul AI Assistant**—a smart, friendly, and reliable chatbot designed to support the entire NavGurukul community.

"NavGurukul is a vibrant organization with a unique educational model. As it grows, so does the need for quick and accurate information. Students, volunteers, and staff often have questions about everything from academic policies and campus norms to daily schedules and the placement process.

"The problem we're solving is simple: how can we provide instant, 24/7 access to this information in a way that's both helpful and easy to use?

"Our solution is this AI Assistant. It’s built to be the first point of contact for any question related to NavGurukul, ensuring everyone has the information they need, right when they need it."

### **Part 2: Live Demonstration (The "How")**

**(Presenter):** "Let's dive into the demo. What you see here is a clean, intuitive chat interface. On the left, you have the AI's welcome message, and on the right, some suggested prompts to get started."

#### **Feature 1: Core Conversational AI**

**(Presenter):** "The assistant is powered by Google's Gemini AI model. Let's start with a basic question. I'll click on one of the suggestions: **'What courses are taught at NavGurukul?'**"

*(Click the prompt. Wait for the answer to stream in.)*

**(Presenter):** "Notice how the answer streams in token by token. This provides immediate feedback that the assistant is working, creating a much better user experience than a simple loading spinner. The AI has been trained with a specific system instruction that gives it a deep understanding of NavGurukul's curriculum, which you can see in its detailed response."

#### **Feature 2: Deep Knowledge & Persona**

**(Presenter):** "Now let's ask something more specific to NavGurukul's unique culture, something that isn't easily found on a public website. I'll ask: **'Tell me about the student-led governance model.'**"

*(Type and send the question. Wait for the response.)*

**(Presenter):** "Here, the assistant explains the concept of 'Etiocracy' and the student councils like 'Disco.' This information is part of its core knowledge base, defined in its system prompt. This ensures that its answers are not just generic but are tailored to NavGurukul's specific terminology and practices."

#### **Feature 3: Grounding with Google Search (Highlight this!)**

**(Presenter):** "This next feature is crucial for ensuring the information is always up-to-date. For questions about things that can change—like staff members, partners, or campus details—we've instructed the AI *not* to guess. Instead, it must perform a live Google search on the official NavGurukul website.

"Let's try it. I'll ask: **'Who is the CEO of NavGurukul?'**"

*(Type and send the question. Wait for the response.)*

**(Presenter):** "The assistant provides the answer, but look closely at what appears below: a **'Search Results'** section. These are the actual web pages the AI used to formulate its answer. This is called 'grounding.' It ensures the information is pulled from a reliable source—in this case, the official website.

"If I click this link..." *(Click one of the source links)* "...it takes me directly to the navgurukul.org page where it found the information. This transparency is key to building trust with our users."

#### **Feature 4: Voice Input**

**(Presenter):** "We wanted to make the assistant accessible to everyone, so we've also included voice input. I can click this microphone icon and ask my question directly."

*(Click the mic icon, which should start pulsing.)*

**(Presenter):** *(Speak clearly)* **"What is the daily schedule like?"**

*(The transcribed text appears in the input box and is sent automatically.)*

**(Presenter):** "The browser's built-in Speech Recognition API transcribes my voice to text, making it easy to interact with the assistant hands-free. We've also built in clear visual feedback for different states, like if microphone access is denied."

#### **Feature 5: User Feedback & Interaction**

**(Presenter):** "On every response from the AI, you'll see these thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons. This feedback is incredibly valuable for us to understand the quality of the answers and fine-tune the model over time.

"Users can also easily copy the response using the copy button, and of course, clear the entire chat history with the 'Clear Chat' button to start fresh."

#### **Feature 6: Accessibility**

**(Presenter):** "Finally, we've put a strong emphasis on accessibility. All interactive elements are properly labeled for screen readers. For example, the chat window is a 'live region,' so new messages are announced automatically.

"We also manage focus intelligently. Notice that after the AI responds, the cursor automatically returns to the text input box. This creates a seamless workflow for keyboard-only users."

### **Part 3: Technical Overview (The "What")**

**(Presenter):** "For those interested in the technology behind the assistant, it's a modern single-page application built with **React** and **TypeScript**, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase.

- The core intelligence is provided by the **Google Gemini API**, specifically the `gemini-2.5-flash` model, which offers a great balance of speed and capability.
- We use **response streaming** to display text in real-time.
- The crucial **Google Search grounding** feature ensures our answers are current and trustworthy.
- The frontend is styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, responsive design.
- It's all powered by modern JavaScript, using ES Modules and import maps, which simplifies our build process."

### **Part 4: Conclusion & Q&A**

**(Presenter):** "In summary, the NavGurukul AI Assistant is more than just a chatbot. It's a reliable, accessible, and knowledgeable resource designed to empower the NavGurukul community. By providing instant access to accurate information, we hope to streamline operations and support the educational mission of the organization.
